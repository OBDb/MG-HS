    description: "The first-generation MG HS was introduced as MG's flagship SUV in many markets, representing the brand's push upmarket with improved quality, design, and technology. Built on the SAIC platform also used for the Roewe RX5, the HS featured European-influenced styling with a large grille featuring the iconic MG logo, sleek LED headlights, and a refined profile intended to compete with established C-segment SUVs. The exterior dimensions positioned it firmly in the compact crossover segment, with a length of approximately 4.6 meters and width of 1.9 meters. Powertrain options varied by market but typically included a 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine producing around 160-169 horsepower and 250 Nm of torque, paired with either a 6-speed manual or 7-speed dual-clutch automatic transmission. Some markets also received a 2.0-liter turbocharged variant with approximately 231 horsepower. The interior represented a significant step up for the MG brand, featuring soft-touch materials, a driver-focused dashboard design with a 10.1-inch central touchscreen, and available leather upholstery. Technology features included the MG Pilot suite of advanced driver assistance systems offering adaptive cruise control, lane keeping assist, and autonomous emergency braking. In 2020, a plug-in hybrid variant was introduced in some markets, combining the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine with an electric motor for a total system output of around 258 horsepower and an electric-only range of approximately 52 kilometers. The facelifted MG Pilot version was introduced in September 2020 at Auto China Beijing, featuring updated styling and enhanced technology. The first-generation HS helped establish MG's position in the competitive compact SUV market by offering premium features and styling at a value price point compared to Japanese and European competitors."

Exterior changes included a revised front fascia with a larger grille featuring a new mesh pattern, updated LED headlights with a more angular design, and restyled bumpers. The rear received subtle updates including revised taillight signatures and bumper design. Inside, the most significant changes came to the technology package, with an updated infotainment system featuring improved graphics, processing power, and connectivity features including wireless smartphone integration in many markets. The center console was redesigned with a new electronic gear selector in automatic models, additional storage options, and improved material quality. The MG Pilot advanced driver assistance suite was enhanced with improved functionality and additional features in some markets. Powertrain options remained largely similar to the pre-facelift model, with the 1.5-liter turbocharged engine continuing as the primary offering, alongside the plug-in hybrid variant in select regions. Additional comfort features were added to higher trim levels, including ventilated seats, panoramic sunroof, and premium audio systems. The refreshed HS maintains the original's focus on offering near-premium features at mainstream pricing, helping MG continue its growth in competitive global markets while addressing some criticisms of the pre-facelift model regarding technology and interior design."
